# LOGIN_AND_SIGNUP
INSTRUCTIONS:
PLACE BOTH FILES WITH THE REST OF THE WEBPAGES. IF IT TELLS YOU LOGIN.PHP ALREADY EXISTS, TELL IT TO REPLACE THE EXISTING FILES

# SIGNUP.php
This is just the orignal login page code copied and with a different name. This is because funtionality wise it works like a signup page (user enters details, details are registered into the DB and user is then taken to homepage

# LOGIN.php
user enters details and a SQL statement is run to check if theres an entry that matches all the details. If so it lets them through and if not does nothing.
this page has some issues such as the message that tells the user that they entered invalid details displaying when the user first enters the login page and overall not having much CSS styling because I was dead set on getting the login functionality
It also does not store the entered details in an associative array because I couldn't get it to work with the new SQL statements.
